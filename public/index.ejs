            <h2>Who We Are</h2>

            <p>TEDxHarvardCollege is a student organization and curation team at Harvard dedicated to bringing about
                the inaugural TEDx event to the Harvard College community. We have a core team of 7 leaders, with a
                general membership of around 40 undergraduates. We are dedicated to ideas worth spreading and
                stories worth telling. Learn more here [link to page with bios] and join us here [link to page about
                comp process].</p>

            <h2>What is TED?</h2>

            <p>TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. Started as a four-day conference in
                California 25 years ago, TED has grown to support those world-changing ideas with multiple
                initiatives. The annual TED Conference invites the world’s leading thinkers and doers to speak for
                18 minutes. Their talks are then made available, free, at TED.com. TED speakers have included Bill
                Gates, Al Gore, Jane Goodall, Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson, Nandan Nilekani, Philippe
                Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Isabel Allende and former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown. The annual
                TED Conference takes place each spring in Long Beach, California, along with the TEDActive simulcast
                in Palm Springs; the annual TEDGlobal conference is held each summer in Edinburgh, Scotland.</p>

            <p>TED's media initiatives include TED.com, where new TEDTalks are posted daily, the recently launched
                TED-Ed platform for students and educators, the Open Translation Project, which provides subtitles
                and interactive transcripts as well as the ability for any TEDTalk to be translated by volunteers
                worldwide, and TEDBooks, short e-books by speakers that elaborate on a single idea originally
                presented on TED's stage. TED has established the annual TED Prize, where exceptional individuals
                with a wish to change the world are given the opportunity to put their wishes into action; TEDx,
                which offers individuals or groups a way to host local, self-organized events around the world, and
                the TED Fellows program, helping world-changing innovators from around the globe to become part of
                the TED community and, with its help, amplify the impact of their remarkable projects and
                activities. Follow TED on Twitter or on Facebook.</p>

            <h2>Core Values</h2>

            <p>TEDxHarvardCollege is founded on the principle of providing a platform for ideas worth sharing.
                Harvard students are coming together for the first time in the College’s history to combine two of
                the largest names in innovation. TEDxHarvardCollege will synthesize TED’s reputation as a global
                education platform with Harvard’s brightest ideas.
            </p>

            <p>In essence, TEDxHarvardCollege is dedicated to promoting ideas worth spreading. Through
                TEDxHarvardCollege’s unique events and collaborations, we connect the world’s brightest minds and
                stories with the global community.</p>

            <p>Our first event will be in the Fall of 2015.</p>

                <h4>TEDxHarvardCollege</h4>

                <p>TEDxHarvardCollege is coming in Fall 2015. We put a year’s worth of planning into our main event to
                    ensure it’s a top-tier conference featuring speakers at the forefront of their fields. Once ticket
                    sales begin, a limited number will be available for the greater Boston community. Stay tuned for
                    more details.</p>

                <h4>Smaller Events</h4>

                <p>Aside from our main conference, TEDxHarvardCollege also facilitates smaller, more frequent events
                    throughout the year, such as our Salons and socials. The TEDx Salon is a periodic gathering of
                    interested individuals to continue the discussion with curated TEDx Talks and live speakers. Our
                    first Salon event will be happening soon -- stay tuned.
                </p>

            <h4>Comp Process</h4>

            <p>As of now, the TEDxHarvardCollege is still relatively small as we are hoping to develop a solid
                foundation for the organization and its core values, a good marketing strategy to attract students and
                convince them that TEDxHarvardCollege is indeed going to be the conference of the year.</p>

            <p> Our board members and restricted number of committee members are working hard to build this strong base
                and make sure TEDxHarvardCollege earns the credibility it deserves.</p>

            <p>BUT…. GET EXCITED PEOPLE!</p>

            <p> Our marketing committee is now designing a comp process tailored for people who are interested in
                joining us!</p>

            <p> The details of the comp process are coming soon but we know for sure that it’s going to be very
                reflective</p>
