                In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called TEDx. TEDx is a program of
                local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Our event is
                called TEDxHarvardCollege, where x = independently organized TED event. At our TEDxHarvardCollege event,
                TEDTalks video
                and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. The TED
                Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including
                ours, are self-organized.
